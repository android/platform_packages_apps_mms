      "message": "Thanks for the fix! I would add a comment explaining what\u0027s going on. I\u0027d also just have a single call to sendIntents.add() and then pass in a variable for the second parameter that gets set in the if case. Did you test this? Does it work? The reason I ask is a comment in PendingIntent.java for getBroadcast(). For the second param, the docs say, \"@param requestCode Private request code for the sender (currently not used).\" I wonder if that comment is obsolete.",
